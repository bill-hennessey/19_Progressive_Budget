# 19_Progressive_Budget

## Description

App that takes in user data, stores it in the cloud DB, and uses the data to populate a graph. If the the user goes offline, the data is stored in the indexedBD web api and pushed to the cloud when the user is back online.

This taught me quite a bit about the service worker and IndexedBd.

## Installation

Nothing to install, simply visit my deployed app on [heroku app](https://afternoon-badlands-38134.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage

Type the transaction name into the field, add the amount to add/subtract, and choose the add or subtract button to apply the changes to the budget. Perform the act again to see the total amount change and the difference reflected in the graph.
